            <!-- COMMON Questions -->
            <h4>Common Questions</h4>
            
            <h3> What does a doctype do?</h3>
            <p>doctype is an instruction to the browser to inform about the version of html document and how browser should render it.</p>

            <h3> What is Semantic HTML? Can you tell me HTML 5 elements?</h3>
            <p>Semantic HTML introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation for example <code>strong</code> instead of <code>b</code> <code>header, aside, nav</code> instead of <code>div</code> </p>

            <h3>Do all HTML tags have an end tag?</h3>
            <p>No. There are some HTML tags that don't need a closing tag. For example: <code>image</code> tag, <code> br </code> tag</p>

            <h3> What is the differences between div and span?</h3>
            <p>The difference is that <code>span</code> gives the output with  <code>display:inline</code> and <code>div</code> gives the output with <code>display:block</code>. span is used when we need our elements to be shown in a line, one after the other.</p>


            <h3> What is the use of the required attribute in HTML5? </h3>
            <p>It forces a user to fill text on the text field or text area before submitting the form. It is used for form validation. Example:  <code> &lt;input type="text" name="name" required&gt; </code></p>

            <h3> Explain the three main ways to apply CSS styles to a web page. When would you prefer which one? </h3>
            <p>
                Inline CSS - You can apply CSS style inside the HTML tags(elements) that’s called inline CSS.<br/>
                Internal Style Sheet - You can apply CSS styles Inside &lt;head&gt; section in HTML using <code>&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</code>.<br/>
                External Style Sheet - Create another file save it with .css extension and then link this css file using <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>.<br/>
            </p>

            <h3> Could you describe the different kinds of selectors? </h3>
            <p>
                We can divide CSS selectors into five categories: <br/>
                <code>Simple selectors</code>(id, class, name etc.)<br/>
                <code>Combinator selectors</code>(descendant selector(space), child selector(>), adjacent sibling selector (+), general sibling selector (~) .)<br/>
                <code>Pseudo-class selectors</code>(visited, hover, link, active etc.)<br/>
                <code>Pseudo-elements selectors</code> (first-line, first-letter etc.)<br/>
                <code>Attribute selectors</code> (a[target] etc.)<br/>
            </p>

            <h3> What is the CSS display property and can you give a few examples of its use? </h3>
            <p>
                The display property specifies the display behavior (the type of rendering box) of an element. <br/>
                <code>display: none;</code><br/>
                <code>display: inline;</code><br/>
                <code>display: block;</code><br/>
                <code>display: inline-block;</code> <br/>

            </p>

            <h3> What is CSS specificity? </h3>
            <p>Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. Check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp" target="_blank"> MDN</a> to learn how they used and calculated.
            </p>

            <h3> How can u highlight text in html? </h3>
            <p>By using <i>&lt;mark&gt; </i> element.  Ex: Hey I am <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> marked <code>&lt;/mark&gt;</code> text!</p>


            <h3> When should you use section, div or article? </h3>
            <p>
                <code>section</code>, group of content inside is related to a single theme, and should appear as an entry in an outline of the page. It’s a chunk of related content, like a subsection of a long article, a major part of the page (eg the news section on the homepage), or a page in a webapp’s tabbed interface. A section normally has a heading (title) and maybe a footer too.<br/>

                <code>article</code>, represents a complete, or self-contained, composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.<br/>

                <code>div</code>, on the other hand, does not convey any meaning, aside from any found in its class, lang and title attributes.
            </p>

            <h3> What does float do? </h3>
            <p>
                <code>float</code> pushes an element to the sides of a page with text wrapped around it. you can create entire page or a smaller area by using float. if size of a floated element changes, text around it will re-flow to accommodate the changes. You can have float left, right, none or inherit.<br/>
                if you set, <code>'float: left;'</code> for an image, it will move to the left until the margin, padding or border of another block-level element is reached. The normal flow will wrap around on the right side.
            </p>


            <h3> How can you fix, "floated points don't add up to the height of a parent"? Basically how do you clear floats? </h3>
            <p>
                 You can use clear: both in an empty div <code> &lt;div style="clear: both;"&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code>, you can use overflow hidden or scroll and you can float the parent as well. Check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_class-clear" target="_blank">Examlpe here</a>
            </p>
            

            <h3> How absolute, relative, fixed and static position differ? </h3>
            <p>
                <code>absolute</code>, place an element exactly where you want to place it. absolute position is actually set relative to the element's parent. if no parent available then relatively place to the page itself.<br/>

                <code>relative</code>, is position an element relative to itself (from where the element would be placed, if u don't apply relative positioning). for example, if u set position relative to an element and set top: 10px, it will move 10px down from where it would be normally.<br/>

                <code>fixed</code>, element is positioned relative to viewport or the browser window itself. viewport doesn't changed if u scroll and hence fixed element will stay right in the same position.<br/>

                <code>static</code>, element will be positioned based on the normal flow of the document. usually, u will use position static to remove other position might be applied to an element.<br/>

                 Check <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position" target="_blank"> MDN Docs for examples </a>
            </p>

            <h3> What are the differences between visibility hidden and display none? </h3>
            <p>
               <code>display:</code> none removes the element from the normal layout flow and allow other elements to fill in. <br/>
               <code>visibility:</code> hidden tag is rendered, it takes space in the normal flow but doesn't show it<br/>

                Check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_display_visibility.asp" target="_blank"> here for examples </a>
            </p>


            <h3> What are the differences between inline, block and inline-block? </h3>
            <p>
                <code>inline</code>, elements do not break the flow. think of span it fits in the line. Important points about inline elements, margin/ padding will push other elements horizontally not vertically. Moreover, inline elements ignores height and width.<br/>

                <code>block</code>, breaks the flow and dont sits inline. they are usually container like div, section, ul and also text p, h1, etc.<br/>

                <code>inline-block</code>, will be similar to inline and will go with the flow of the page. Only differences is this this will take height and width.<br/>

                Check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_inline-block.asp" target="_blank"> here for examples </a>
            </p>

            <h3> What is Box Model?  What are the properties related to it? </h3>
            <p>
                Technically, height, width, padding and border are part of box model and margin is related to it.<br/>

                <i>Extra:</i> Everything in a web page is a box where you can control size, position, background, etc. Each box/ content area is optionally surrounded by padding, border and margin. When you set height and width of an element, you set content height and width.<br>

                Check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp" target="_blank"> here for examples </a>
            </p>

            <h3> How <code>overflow</code> attribute works in CSS ? </h3>
            <p>
                The CSS overflow property controls what happens to content that is too big to fit into an area.<br>

                Check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_overflow_intro" target="_blank"> here for examples </a>
            </p>

            <h3> How do you align a p center-center inside a div? </h3>
            <p>
                <code>text-align: center</code> will do the horizontal alignment but <code>vertical-align: middle</code> will not work here. there are couple of different ways to solve this problem and one of them are positioning. You make the parent as relative position and child as absolute positioning. And then define all position parameter as sero and width 50% and height 30%.<br>

                Check <a href="http://vanseodesign.com/css/vertical-centering/" target="_blank"> here for examples </a>
            </p>


            <h3> Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed? </h3>
            <p>
                The z-index property in CSS controls the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap. z-index only affects elements that have a position value which is not static.<br>

                Without any z-index value, elements stack in the order that they appear in the DOM (the lowest one down at the same hierarchy level appears on top). Elements with non-static positioning (and their children) will always appear on top of elements with default static positioning, regardless of HTML hierarchy.<br>

                A stacking context is an element that contains a set of layers. Within a local stacking context, the z-index values of its children are set relative to that element rather than to the document root. Layers outside of that context — i.e. sibling elements of a local stacking context — can't sit between layers within it. If an element B sits on top of element A, a child element of element A, element C, can never be higher than element B even if element C has a higher z-index than element B.<br>

                Each stacking context is self-contained - after the element's contents are stacked, the whole element is considered in the stacking order of the parent stacking context. A handful of CSS properties trigger a new stacking context, such as opacity less than 1, filter that is not none, and transform that is notnone.<br>

            </p>

            <h3> Should you use !important? </h3>
            <p>
                When you’re wrestling with specificity, trying to override that one style, you may be tempted to add !important to your style. Think very carefully before you do so! It may seem harmless, but if you do this all over the place, you will soon find yourself in a big mess that you cannot get out of.<br>

                What !important does, is make that particular style have the highest specificity possible. Nothing else can override it, apart from another !important. You might be able to see where this is going, but once you start using them, you’ll almost certainly get into a position where you need to override a rule marked as !important, which forces you to use another one. And so the cycle continues.<br>
                <code>
                    /* high specificity */<br>
                    .large .navigation.navigation-large { <br>
                        font-size: 2em;<br>
                    }<br>

                    /* will override the above, but it's dangerous! */<br>
                    .navigation {<br>
                        font-size: 3em !important;<br>
                    }
                </code>
            </p>

            <h3> What is the difference between <code>px</code>, <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> sizing fonts? </h3>
            <p>
                <code>TL;DR:</code>

                    <code>Pixels</code> are ignorant, don’t use them.
                    Use <code>REMs</code> for sizes and spacing.
                    Use <code>EMs</code> for media queries.<br>

            <h3> What's the difference between the <code>nth-of-type()</code> and <code>nth-child()</code> selectors?</h3>

            <p>
                <code>TL;DR:</code><br>

                    <code>:nth-child</code> selector, in “Plain English,” means select an element if:<br>

                    It is a paragraph element<br>
                    It is the second child of a parent<br>
                    <code>:nth-of-type</code> selector, in “Plain English,” means:<br>

                    Select the second paragraph child of a parent<br>

            <h3> Explain the term Responsive web design ? </h3>
            <p>
                It is a method in which we design and develop a web page according to the user activities and conditions which are based on various components like the size of the screen, portability of the web page on the different devices, etc. It is done by using different flexible layouts and grids.
            </p>

            <h3> How do we make a rounded corner by using CSS? </h3>
            <p>
                We can make a rounded corner by using the property <code>border-radius</code>. We can apply this property to any element.
            </p>

            <h3> What is CSS flexbox? </h3>
            <p>
                It allows you to design a flexible responsive layout structure without using any float or positioning property of CSS. To use CSS flexbox you need to define a flex container initially.
            </p>

            <h3> Write all the properties of the flexbox? </h3>
            <p>
                There are several properties of the flexbox that are used in the HTML webpage.<br>

                They are:<br>

                flex-direction<br>
                flex-wrap<br>
                flex-flow<br>
                justify-content<br>
                align-items<br>
                align-content<br>
            </p>

            <h3> How can we add icons to the web page?</h3>
            <p>
                We can add icons to the HTML webpage by using an icon library like font-awesome.<br>

                We have to add the name of the given icon class to any inline HTML element. ( &lt;i&gt; or  &lt;span&gt;) . Icons in the icon libraries are scalable vectors that can be customized with CSS.
            </p>

            <h3>What are the differences between relative and absolute in CSS?</h3>
            <p>
               The main difference between relative and absolute is that “relative” is used for the same tag in CSS and it means that if we write the left:10px then the padding will shift to 10px in the left while absolute is totally relative to the non-static parent.<br>

               It means, if we write left:10px then the result will be 10px far from the left edge of the parent element.
            </p>

            <h3>Differentiate between inline and block element?</h3>
            <p>
               Inline element does not have an element to set width and height and also it does not have the line break. Ex: <code>em, strong</code> etc.<br>
               Block element specification:<br>

                They do have the line break.<br>
                They define the width by setting a container and also allow setting height.<br>
                It can also contain an element that occurs in the inline element.<br>
            </p>

            <h3>What are empty elements?</h3>
            <p>
               HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. For example: &lt;br&gt;, &lt;hr&gt; etc.
            </p>

            <h3>What are the different new form element types in HTML 5?</h3>
            <p>
               Following is a list of 10 frequently used new elements in HTML 5:<br>

                - Color<br>
                - Date<br>
                - Datetime-local<br>

            <h4>Behavioral Questions</h4>

            <h3>When did you start experimenting with CSS?</h3>
            <p>
                The answer to this question gives you an idea of how much experience the job applicant has working with CSS. It can also tell you whether the person picked up the skill as a hobby or learned it in an academic or professional environment.<br>

                What to look for in an answer:<br>

                - Amount of experience with CSS<br>
                - Interest in building websites<br>
                - Excitement about new technology<br>
                Example: “I started using style sheets in high school. A few friends and I had been building a website about our favorite television shows. Eventually, the pages became a mess because they didn’t share a common aesthetic. The fonts and colors were different on every page. I learned how to use CSS so I could bring the pages into harmony without writing new HTML tags for each page.”

            <h3>What is your favorite CSS feature?</h3>
            <p>
                It probably doesn’t matter what CSS feature your job applicant likes most. Finding out whether the person can speak freely about style sheets, however, shows that your applicant has a strong knowledge of CSS.<br>

                - Understanding of CSS<br>
                - How to use CSS to save time<br>
                Example: “I started using style sheets in high school. A few friends and I had been building a website about our favorite television shows. Eventually, the pages became a mess because they didn’t share a common aesthetic. The fonts and colors were different on every page. I learned how to use CSS so I could bring the pages into harmony without writing new HTML tags for each page.”
            </p>


            <h3>Do you use CSS in combination with other markup or programming languages?</h3>
            <p>
                Web developers often rely on a few languages to build dynamic sites. The answer to this question shows that the applicant knows about other languages used to build sites. By prompting the person to name the languages, you make sure that the applicant has a deep understanding of the subject.<br>

                What to look for in an answer:<br>
                
                - Interest in front-end design<br>
                - Other language skills<br>
                - Creative problem solving<br>
                Example: “I started using style sheets in high school. A few friends and I had been building a website about our favorite television shows.

            <h3>Can you tell me about a project that forced you to learn something new about CSS?</h3>
            <p>
                Asking this question encourages people to reflect on their experiences with CSS. The answer may reveal several things, such as how much experience applicants have with CSS and how they use critical thinking to solve difficult problems.<br>

                What to look for in an answer:<br>

                - Understanding of CSS<br>
                - Amount of experience with CSS<br>
                - Critical thinking<br>
                Example: “I took a multidisciplinary class in college that created groups of librarians and engineers to work on unique projects. My group decided to digitize a large collection of handwritten poems in the library’s permanent collection. Making a style sheet that could accommodate the different sizes, shapes and qualities of the poems took a lot of effort.”

            <h3>What’s your favorite project that required CSS?</h3>
            <p>
                This question gives you some insight into what the interviewee enjoys. The answer says more about the applicant’s personality than programming skills.<br>

                What to look for in an answer:<br>

                - Understanding of CSS's benefits<br>
                - Creative problem solving<br>

                Example: “I helped a friend build an online magazine that published articles, photographs, music and all kinds of media. It wasn’t a hard project. In fact, it was pretty easy. I just loved watching how happy my simple CSS changes made him. Over a few hours, his website went from OK to excellent. It reminded me of why it’s important to know CSS, JavaScript and other common languages in today’s world. You can’t do anything without building a good website to show it off.”
            </p>

            <h3>Do you have a resource that you use when you can’t remember a CSS function?</h3>
            <p>
                Programmers can’t keep everything in their heads, so they rely on references when they remember specific functions and terms. The answer to this question shows that the applicant knows about reliable CSS resources that may come in handy when working on future projects.<br>

I just loved watching how happy my simple CSS changes made him. Over a few hours, his website went from OK to excellent.

            <h3>What is your least favorite part of working with CSS?</h3>
            <p>
                All people have things that they don’t like about their jobs. An honest answer to this question can help you place an applicant with the right team. For instance, if a person loves finding errors in CSS files, you may want to hire that applicant to work on a project with creative people who prefer focusing on the big picture.<br>

                What to look for in an answer:<br>

                - Understanding the pros and cons of CSS<br>
                - Knowing what role the applicant could play<br>
                - Learning about the applicant's other interests<br>
                Example: “CSS makes Web design a lot easier, but it still feels a little tedious. Ideally, I’d like to work with a dynamic language that lets users interact with websites. For the time being, though, I’m happy to hone my CSS skills and learn from more experienced people.”
            </p>

            <h3>What are some limitations of CSS? Do you know any?</h3>

                There are several limitations of CSS such as:<br>

                - CSS can’t fulfill turning completeness hence, it can never perform logical like ‘if/else’, for/while, etc, or arithmetical tasks<br>
                - One cannot read files using CSS<br>
                - It cannot provide total control over document display and allows the contents of the page to come through whatever the browser is used.<br>
                - Ascending by selectors is not possible<br>
                - Limitations of vertical control<br>
                - No expressions as it is a text-based coding language<br>
                - No column declaration<br>
                - Pseudo-class not controlled by dynamic behavior<br>
                - Rules, styles, targeting specific text not possible<br>
            </p>

            <h3>What are the different versions of CSS? Which one you use right now?</h3>
