            <!-- COMMON Questions -->
            <h4>Common Questions</h4>
            
            <h3> What does a doctype do?</h3>
            <p>doctype is an instruction to the browser to inform about the version of html document and how browser should render it.</p>

            <h3> What is Semantic HTML? Can you tell me HTML 5 elements?</h3>
            <p>Semantic HTML introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation for example <code>strong</code> instead of <code>b</code> <code>header, aside, nav</code> instead of <code>div</code> </p>

            <h3>Do all HTML tags have an end tag?</h3>
            <p>No. There are some HTML tags that don't need a closing tag. For example: <code>image</code> tag, <code> br </code> tag</p>

            <h3> What is the differences between div and span?</h3>
            <p>The difference is that <code>span</code> gives the output with  <code>display:inline</code> and <code>div</code> gives the output with <code>display:block</code>. span is used when we need our elements to be shown in a line, one after the other.</p>


            <h3> What is the use of the required attribute in HTML5? </h3>
            <p>It forces a user to fill text on the text field or text area before submitting the form. It is used for form validation. Example:  <code> &lt;input type="text" name="name" required&gt; </code></p>

            <h3> Explain the three main ways to apply CSS styles to a web page. When would you prefer which one? </h3>
            <p>
                Inline CSS - You can apply CSS style inside the HTML tags(elements) that’s called inline CSS.<br/>
                Internal Style Sheet - You can apply CSS styles Inside &lt;head&gt; section in HTML using <code>&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</code>.<br/>
                External Style Sheet - Create another file save it with .css extension and then link this css file using <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>.<br/>
            </p>

            <h3> Could you describe the different kinds of selectors? </h3>
            <p>
                We can divide CSS selectors into five categories: <br/>
                <code>Simple selectors</code>(id, class, name etc.)<br/>
                <code>Combinator selectors</code>(descendant selector(space), child selector(>), adjacent sibling selector (+), general sibling selector (~) .)<br/>
                <code>Pseudo-class selectors</code>(visited, hover, link, active etc.)<br/>
                <code>Pseudo-elements selectors</code> (first-line, first-letter etc.)<br/>
                <code>Attribute selectors</code> (a[target] etc.)<br/>
            </p>

            <h3> What is CSS specificity? </h3>
            <p>Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. Check <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity#:~:text=Specificity%20is%20the%20means%20by,different%20sorts%20of%20CSS%20selectors." target="_blank"> MDN</a> to learn how they used and calculated.
            </p>

            <h3> How can u highlight text in html? </h3>
            <p>By using <i>&lt;mark&gt; </i> element.  Ex: Hey I am <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> marked <code>&lt;/mark&gt;</code> text!</p>


            <h3> When should you use section, div or article? </h3>
            <p>
                <code>section</code>, group of content inside is related to a single theme, and should appear as an entry in an outline of the page. It’s a chunk of related content, like a subsection of a long article, a major part of the page (eg the news section on the homepage), or a page in a webapp’s tabbed interface. A section normally has a heading (title) and maybe a footer too.<br/>

                <code>article</code>, represents a complete, or self-contained, composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.<br/>

                <code>div</code>, on the other hand, does not convey any meaning, aside from any found in its class, lang and title attributes.
            </p>

            <h3> What does float do? </h3>
            <p>
                <code>float</code> pushes an element to the sides of a page with text wrapped around it. you can create entire page or a smaller area by using float. if size of a floated element changes, text around it will re-flow to accommodate the changes. You can have float left, right, none or inherit.<br/>
                if you set, <code>'float: left;'</code> for an image, it will move to the left until the margin, padding or border of another block-level element is reached. The normal flow will wrap around on the right side.
            </p>


            <h3> How can you fix, "floated points don't add up to the height of a parent"? Basically how do you clear floats? </h3>
            <p>
                 You can use clear: both in an empty div <code> &lt;div style="clear: both;"&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code>, you can use overflow hidden or scroll and you can float the parent as well.

            </p>
            

            <h3> How absolute, relative, fixed and static position differ? </h3>
            <p>
                <code>absolute</code>, place an element exactly where you want to place it. absolute position is actually set relative to the element's parent. if no parent available then relatively place to the page itself.<br/>

                <code>relative</code>, is position an element relative to itself (from where the element would be placed, if u don't apply relative positioning). for example, if u set position relative to an element and set top: 10px, it will move 10px down from where it would be normally.<br/>

                <code>fixed</code>, element is positioned relative to viewport or the browser window itself. viewport doesn't changed if u scroll and hence fixed element will stay right in the same position.<br/>

                <code>static</code>, element will be positioned based on the normal flow of the document. usually, u will use position static to remove other position might be applied to an element.<br/>

                 Check <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position" target="_blank"> MDN Docs for examples </a>
            </p>

            <h3> What are the differences between visibility hidden and display none? </h3>
            <p>
               <code>display:</code> none removes the element from the normal layout flow and allow other elements to fill in. <br/>
               <code>visibility:</code> hidden tag is rendered, it takes space in the normal flow but doesn't show it<br/>

                Check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_display_visibility.asp" target="_blank"> here for examples </a>
            </p>


            <h3> What are the differences between inline, block and inline-block? </h3>
            <p>
                <code>inline</code>, elements do not break the flow. think of span it fits in the line. Important points about inline elements, margin/ padding will push other elements horizontally not vertically. Moreover, inline elements ignores height and width.<br/>

                <code>block</code>, breaks the flow and dont sits inline. they are usually container like div, section, ul and also text p, h1, etc.<br/>

                <code>inline-block</code>, will be similar to inline and will go with the flow of the page. Only differences is this this will take height and width.<br/>

                Check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_inline-block.asp" target="_blank"> here for examples </a>
            </p>

            <h3> What is Box Model?  What are the properties related to it? </h3>
            <p>
                Technically, height, width, padding and border are part of box model and margin is related to it.<br/>

                <i>Extra:</i> Everything in a web page is a box where you can control size, position, background, etc. Each box/ content area is optionally surrounded by padding, border and margin. When you set height and width of an element, you set content height and width.<br>

                Check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp" target="_blank"> here for examples </a>
            </p>

            <h3> How <code>overflow</code> attribute works in CSS ? </h3>
            <p>
                The CSS overflow property controls what happens to content that is too big to fit into an area.<br>

                Check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_overflow_intro" target="_blank"> here for examples </a>
            </p>

            <h3> How do you align a p center-center inside a div? </h3>
            <p>
                <code>text-align: center</code> will do the horizontal alignment but <code>vertical-align: middle</code> will not work here. there are couple of different ways to solve this problem and one of them are positioning. You make the parent as relative position and child as absolute positioning. And then define all position parameter as sero and width 50% and height 30%.<br>

                Check <a href="http://vanseodesign.com/css/vertical-centering/" target="_blank"> here for examples </a>
            </p>


            <h3> Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed? </h3>
            <p>
                The z-index property in CSS controls the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap. z-index only affects elements that have a position value which is not static.<br>

                Without any z-index value, elements stack in the order that they appear in the DOM (the lowest one down at the same hierarchy level appears on top). Elements with non-static positioning (and their children) will always appear on top of elements with default static positioning, regardless of HTML hierarchy.<br>

                A stacking context is an element that contains a set of layers. Within a local stacking context, the z-index values of its children are set relative to that element rather than to the document root. Layers outside of that context — i.e. sibling elements of a local stacking context — can't sit between layers within it. If an element B sits on top of element A, a child element of element A, element C, can never be higher than element B even if element C has a higher z-index than element B.<br>

                Each stacking context is self-contained - after the element's contents are stacked, the whole element is considered in the stacking order of the parent stacking context. A handful of CSS properties trigger a new stacking context, such as opacity less than 1, filter that is not none, and transform that is notnone.<br>
